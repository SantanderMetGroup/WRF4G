===== WELCOME =====

The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing 
of computing resources: clusters, supercomputers, stand-alone servers... It
supports different LRM systems (PBS, SGE, LSF, Condor) within a single
organization or scattered across several administrative domains. GridWay
provides a single point of access to all resources in your organization, from
in-house systems to Grid infrastructures and Cloud providers.

GridWay supports most of existing Grid middlewares (Globus WS and pre-WS, LCG, 
CREAM, ARC) and has being used on main production Grid infrastructures (EGEE,
OSG, TeraGrid).

===== INSTALLATION =====

Check the Installation Guide for more details.

Depending on whether you need a single-user or multi-user configuration, it gets
slightly more complex due to the role of GridWay administrator. In any case, it
summarizes to these steps:

1) Install the required packages (make, gcc, java, ruby...)
2) In a multi-user configuration, create the gwusers group and the gwadmin user.
3) Set the envinronment ($GW_LOCATION, $GLOBUS_LOCATION, $JAVA_HOME, $PATH,
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH...)
4) Change to the directory containing the GridWay distribution.
5) Execute "./configure; make; make install".
6) Build and install the needed drivers executing "make; make install", in
$GW_LOCATION/src/{im_mad,em_mad,tm_mad}. Before, make sure you have installed
the needed middleware (client-side) and packages. Some drivers have specific
requirements that will be shown at build time.
7) Configure GridWay through the file $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf (check the
Configuration Guide).
8) Launch the GridWay daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
9) Test it and enjoy!
