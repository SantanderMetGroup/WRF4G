# Resource sections: [resource]
#
# If you want to add a resource, you have to add a [resource] section.
# The resources are featured by the value of the keys.
#
# Common keys to all resources:
#
#    * enable:         True or False in order to enable or disable the resource
#
#    * communicator:  
#        - local:      The resource will be accessed directly
#        - ssh:        The resource will be accessed through ssh protocol
#    * username:       username to log on the front-end 
#    * frontend:       Front-end of the cluster. The syntax is "host:port", by default port is 22. 
#    * private_key:    Private key identity file to log on the front-end. Otherwise, you can delegate
#                      your private keys in the ssh-agent and DRM4G will load from it
#
#    * lrms: 
#        - pbs:        TORQUE/OpenPBS cluster
#        - sge:        Grid Engine cluster 
#        - slurm:      SLURM cluster
#        - lsf:        LSF cluster
#        - fork:       SHELL
#        - cream:      CREAM Compute Elements (CE)
#
# Keys for Non-Grid resources such as HPC resources:
#
#    * queue:          Queue available on the resource. If there are several, you have to use a "," as follows  
#	                     "queue  = short,medium,long"
#    * ncores:         Number of cores provided by the resource
#    * parallel_env:   It defines the parallel environments available for Grid Engine cluster
#    * project:        It specifies the project variable and is only for TORQUE/OpenPBS and Grid Engine clusters
#    * scratch:        Directory to store the temporary files. It must be a network shared directory. 
#                      The path to scratch should be the same on each node
#    * local_scratch:  It is the scratch directory on the local disk of each node. When it is specified,
#                      WRF4G will use it to store temporary files. 
#
# Keys for Grid resources:
# 
#    * vo:             Virtual Organization (VO) name
#    * bdii:           It indicates the BDII host to be used. The syntax is "bdii:port"
#    * myproxy_server: Server to store the Grid credentials.
#
# Examples:
#
# By DEFAULT, DRM4G is going to use the local machine as 'fork' lrms:
#
[localhost]
