#                      GridWay Scheduler CONFIGURATION FILE
#                      ------------------------------------
#
# Built-in scheduling policies configuration file. These policies may be 
# disabled by uncommenting the following line. You would be interested in 
# disabling the scheduler only if you have developed your own scheduler module
#
# DISABLE = yes 
#
# This file has two parts: job and resource prioritization policies. These two
# policies are combined to derived a Grid scheduling policy.
#*******************************************************************************

#*******************************************************************************
# 1. JOB SCHEDULING POLICIES
# --------------------------
# 
# Pending jobs are prioritize according four policies: 
#   - fixed (FP), 
#   - share(SH), 
#   - deadline (DL),
#   - waiting-time (WT). 
# The dispatch priority of a job is computed as a weighted sum of the 
# contribution of each policy:
#
#   Job Priority = Wfp * FP + Wsh * SH + Wdl * DL + Wwt * WT
#
# The administrator can set a wide-range of policies by adjusting the weights. 
# So tuning the behavior of GridWay for the organization needs.
# Note that before computing the Priority each contribution is normalized to one.
#
# DISPATCH_CHUNK: The maximum number of jobs that will be dispatched each 
# scheduling action. Default value is 15, 0 dispatch as many jobs as possible.
#
# MAX_RUNNING_USER: The maximum number of simultaneous running jobs per user.
# Default value is 30, 0 to dispatch as many jobs as possible.
#*******************************************************************************

DISPATCH_CHUNK   = 40
MAX_RUNNING_USER = 0

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.1 Fixed Priority (FP) Policy
# Assign a fixed priority to each job (FP range [0,19])
#
# FP_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 1 (real numbers allowed)
#
# FP_USER[<username>]: Priority for jobs owned by <username>. Use the special
# username DEFAULT to set default priorities.
#
# FP_GROUP[<groupname>]: Priority for jobs owned by users in group <groupname>.
#
# Example:
#  FP_USER[alice]   = 5
#  FP_USER[david]   = 3
#  FP_USER[DEFAULT] = 1
#
#  FP_GROUP[staff]  = 4
#
# Note: gwadmin can submit "urgent" jobs (priority = 20), that are dispatched as 
# soon as possible.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FP_WEIGHT        = 1
FP_USER[DEFAULT] = 0

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.2 Share (SH) Policy
# Allows to establish a dispatch ratio among users. GridWay tracks the jobs 
# submitted by each user so it targets the defined ratio.
#
# SH_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 1 (real numbers allowed)
#
# SH_USER[<username>]: Share for jobs owned by <username>. Use the special
# username DEFAULT to set default shares.
#
# SH_WINDOW_DEPTH: Number of intervals (windows) to "remember" each user 
# dispatching history. The submissions of each window are exponentially 
# "forgotten". Default is 5, and the maximum value is 10.
#
# SH_WINDOW_SIZE: The size of each interval in days. 
# Default is 1, real numbers allowed.
#
# Example:
#  SH_USER[alice]   = 4
#  SH_USER[david]   = 2
#  SH_USER[DEFAULT] = 1
#
#  SH_WINDOW_SIZE   = 0.5
#  SH_WINDOW_DEPTH  = 5
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SH_WEIGHT        = 1
SH_USER[DEFAULT] = 5

SH_WINDOW_SIZE   = 1
SH_WINDOW_DEPTH  = 5

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.2 Waiting-time (WT) Policy
# The priority of a job is increased linearly with the waiting time to prevent 
# job starvation
#
# WT_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 0 (real numbers allowed)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WT_WEIGHT = 1

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.3 Deadline (DL) Policy
# The priority of a job is increased exponentially as its deadline approaches.
#
# DL_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 1 (real numbers allowed)
#
# DL_HALF: Number of remaining days when the job should get half of the maximum 
# priority. Default is 1 (real numbers allowed).
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DL_WEIGHT = 1
DL_HALF   = 1

#*******************************************************************************
# 2. RESOURCE SCHEDULING POLICIES
# -------------------------------
#
# The resource policies allows administrators to influence the usage of 
# resources made by the users, according to:
#    - fixed (RP)
#    - rank  (RA)
#    - failure rate (FR)
#    - usage (UG)
#
# The suitability priority of a resource is computed as a weighted sum of the
# contribution of each policy:
#
#    Resource Priority = Wrp * RP + Wfr * FR + Wug * UG
# Note that before computing the Priority each contribution is normalized to one.
#
# MAX_RUNNING_RESOURCE: The maximum number of jobs that the scheduler submits to
# a given resource. Default is 10.
#*******************************************************************************

MAX_RUNNING_RESOURCE = 10000

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.1 Fixed Priority (RP) Policy
# Assigned a fixed priority (range [01,99]) to each resource based on: the IM 
# that discovered it, or its FQDN. Those resources with priority 00 WILL NOT be
# used to dispatch jobs. 
#
# RP_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 1 (real numbers allowed).
#
# RP_HOST[<FQDN>]: Priority for resource <FQDN>
#
# RP_IM[<im_tag>]: Priority for All resources discovered by the IM <im_tag> (as 
# set in gwd.conf). The special tag DEFAULT to set default priorities for
# resources
#
# Example:
#     RP_HOST[cygnus.dacya.ucm.es] = 00 # Do not use cygnus
#     RP_HOST[hydrus.dacya.ucm.es] = 10
#
#     RP_IM[intranet] = 20 # resources discovered in the intranet have
#     RP_IM[partner]  = 01 # more priority
#
#     RP_IM[DEFAULT]  = 02
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RP_WEIGHT      = 1
RP_IM[DEFAULT] = 01

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.3 Usage (UG) Policy
# Resources are prioritized based on the estimated execution time of a job (on
# each resource). The estimation is derived from the sum of two contributions:
#
#     T = (1-w) * T_history + w * T_last
# 
# T_history: Average execution time on a given period of time (DB support MUST
# be compiled in GridWay)
#
# T_last: Execution statistics of the last job.
#
# UG_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 1 (real numbers allowed).
#
# UG_HISTORY_WINDOW: Number of days use to compute the T_history contribution
# Default is 3 (real numbers allowed)
#
# UG_HISTORY_RATIO: w in the above expression. Default is 0.25
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UG_WEIGHT         = 1
UG_HISTORY_WINDOW = 3
UG_HISTORY_RATIO  = 0.25

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.3 Rank (RA) Policy
# Prioritize resources based on their RANK (as defined in the job template)
#
# RA_WEIGHT: Weight for the policy. Default is 0 (real numbers allowed).
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RA_WEIGHT = 1

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.4 Failure Rate (FR) Policy
# Resources with persistent failures are banned
#
# FR_MAX_BANNED: The maximum time a resource is banned, in seconds. Default is
# one hour. USE 0 TO DISABLE THIS POLICY
#
# FR_BANNED_C: Exponential constant to compute banned time. Default is 650
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FR_MAX_BANNED = 0
FR_BANNED_C   = 650
