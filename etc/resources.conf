#
# Resource sections: [resource:name]
#
# If you want to add a resource, you have to add a resource section.
# The resources are featured by the value of the keys.
#
# Common keys for all resources:
#
#    * enable:         True or False in order to enable or disable a resource.
#
#    * communicator:  
#        - local:      The resource will be accessed directly.
#        - ssh:        The resource will be accessed through ssh protocol.
#    * username:       username to log on the front-end. 
#    * frontend:       The front-end either of a cluster or a grid User Interface (UI) . The syntax is "host:port", by default the port used is 22 
#    * private_key:    Private key identity either file or string in order to log on the front-end. Otherwise, you can delegate
#                      your private keys in the ssh-agent and DRM4G will load from it.
#
#    * lrms: 
#        - pbs:        TORQUE/OpenPBS cluster.
#        - sge:        Grid Engine cluster. 
#        - slurm:      SLURM cluster.
#        - lsf:        LSF cluster.
#        - fork/none:  SHELL.
#        - cream:      CREAM Compute Elements (CE).
#
# Keys for lrms such as pbs, sge, slurm and fork/none :
#
#    * queue:          Queue available on the resource. If there are several queues, you have to use a "," as follows  
#                      "queue  = short,medium,long".
#    * ncores:         Number of cores provided by the resource.
#    * parallel_env:   It defines the parallel environments available for Grid Engine cluster.
#    * project:        It specifies the project variable and is for TORQUE/OpenPBS,  Grid Engine and LSF clusters.
#
# Keys for lrms such as cream :
# 
#    * vo:             Virtual Organization (VO) name.
#    * bdii:           It indicates the BDII host to be used. The syntax is "bdii:port".
#                      If you do not specify this variable, the LCG_GFAL_INFOSYS environment variable defined on the 
#                      Grid UI will be used by default.                      
#    * myproxy_server: Server to store Grid credentials.
#                      If you do not specify this variable, the MYPROXY_SERVER environment variable defined on the
#                      Grid UI will be used by default. 
#


#
# The [DEFAULT] section is optional. 
# The values defined in the [DEFAULT] section will be used as default values in other sections.
