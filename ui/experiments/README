******* WRF4G test experiments *******

 * single [c]: Experiment of a single realization. 
   o Idoneous experiment for long simulations like: regional climate 
    research and dynamical downscaling

 * multipledates [h]: Experiment as combination of realizations which 
   have the same length, but started at different dates.
   o Idoneous experiment for: hindcast, re-forecast

 * multipleparameters [m]: Experiment as combination of realizations 
   of the same length and date of start, but with differences in the
   configuration of the WRF model (changes in namelists' parameters). 
   o Idoneous for: sensitivity studies

 * ensemble [e]: Experiment as combination of realizations of multiple 
   dates and multiple parameters. 
   o Idoneous for: statistical forecasting

 * Each folder have different experiments. It must be 'wrf.input' and 
     'experiment.wrf4g'. A 'wrf4g_files' folder will be used for that 
      staff specific for the experiment. All its content will placed
      at the same folder where it is running WPS and/or WRF
 * Some experiments have a 'wrf.input_comment' where it is commented 
      the meaning of each value (it is full operative, you need just
      to change the name)

== Available experiments ==

test[c/h/m/e]: 
 * Very fast experiment: (real time simulation less than 5 minutes) 
 * Small domain of integration of 10x10 grid points, with 26 levels
 * Grid spacing: 50 km
 * 36 hour experiment of a extreme precipitation event along the 
     Cantabrian coast occurred on 25-27th August 1983 

wrfuc[chm]:
 * Daily-operative experiment running on the 'Grupo de Meteorologia 
    de Santander' (GMS).
 * 5 days forecast of 3 domains with 5 members of different physics 
    (http://www.meteo.unican.es/imeteo/comienzo.html)
 * Three nested domains of 130x120 (dom1), 169x148 (dom2) 82x91 (dom3)
    with 40 levels
 * single/wrfuc: one single domain
 * single/wrfuc2dom: two domains
 * Grid spacing: 27, 9 and 9 km
 * Episode of an explosive cyclogenesis along the Cantabrian
     coast occurred on 23-24th January 2009

== User configurable experiments ==
 * User can check his/her own input data with the provided experiments.     One just need to place the files with similar pattern name and 
     content in the same folder where are the provided ones. New data
     will be used over the same domain along a different period if 
     user changes it
