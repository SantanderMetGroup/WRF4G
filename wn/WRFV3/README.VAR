V3.1 Release Notes:
-----------------------

Version 3.1 is released on April 9, 2009.

- For more information on WRFDA, visit the new WRFDA Users home page
  http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/index.html
  and read the online User's Gudie.

- 4DVAR and radiance data assimilation capabilities are included in V3.1.

- New README files under WRFDA/var (README.namelist, README.basics, 
  README.radiance)

- WRFDA V3.1 executable will work with V3.0 wrfinput/wrfbdy (but requires 
  inserting a new namelist variable use_baseparam_fr_nml in &dynamics).
  However, rerunning V3.1 WPS/real.exe is recommended.

- Changes to namelist variables.
    * Some obsolete or unused namelist variables are removed, some new namelist 
      variables are added, purposes of some namelist variables are changed.
      See WRFDA/var/README.namelist for descriptions of supported namelist 
      variables.

- Changes to obsproc:
    * the executable is renamed to be obsproc.exe from 3dvar_obs.exe and
      namelist.3dvar_obs is renamed to be namelist.obsproc to reflect
      its capabilitiy of producing WRFDA-ready observations for 3DVAR, FGAT,
      or 4DVAR applications.
      See WRFDA/var/obsproc/README.
    * compilation of obsproc.exe is included in "compile all_wrfvar"

- Changes to diagnostic output files
    * gts_omb_oma becomes gts_omb_oma_01 (01 indicates outer loop index)
    * observations that fail check_max_iv are listed in rej_obs_conv_01.000
      ( 01 is outer loop index, 000 is processor id)
    * qcstat_conv_01 (01 indicates outer loop index) contains observation 
      number counts

- Most of the scripts under WRFDA/var/scripts are removed from the main source
  code tar file. They can still be downloaded separately.
  See http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/download/tools.html

How to compile and run?
-----------------------

- In WRFDA directory, type 'configure wrfda - this will create a configure.wrf
  file that has appropriate compile options for the supported computers.

  Note: WRFDA requires netCDF, BLAS, LAPACK libraries.
        If using PREPBUFR data, NCEP BUFR library is required.
        If using radiance data, NCEP BUFR and CRTM 1.2/RTTOV 8.7 are required.
        Install required libraries and set environment variables properly 
        before you type 'configure wrfda'. For example, 

        setenv NETCDF /usr/local/netcdf-pgi
        setenv BLAS /usr/local/blas
        setenv LAPACK /usr/local/lapack
        setenv BUFR /usr/local/bufr (optional)
        setenv CRTM /usr/local/crtm_1_2 (optional)
        setenv RTTOV /usr/local/rttov87 (optional)

- Type 'compile all_wrfvar' when your are ready:

- If sucessful, this will create da_wrfvar.exe and a set of utilities
  in directory WRFDA/var/build/. 

- cd to the appropriate test or run directory to run WRFDA.

     Some basic instruction/namelist.input are available in sub-directories
     of WRFDA/var/test.
